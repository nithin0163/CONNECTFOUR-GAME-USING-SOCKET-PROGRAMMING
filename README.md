# CONNECTFOUR-GAME-USING-SOCKET-PROGRAMMING
This project is based on Socket programming which provides an
online multi-player game on single server using threads in java by
using Socket and ServerSocket classes communicating by CFP
(Connect Four protocol), with graphical interface on client side using
Swing and the NetBeans IDE.

Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which
the players first take turns dropping one colored disc
from the top into an eight-column, six-row vertically
suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying
the lowest available space within the column. The
objective of the game is to be the first to form a
horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own
discs.

Client uses Graphical User Interface (GUI) programming
with Swing and the NetBeans IDE. Uses CFP(connect
four protocol) for client/server connection. Threaded to
allow multiple clients to play concurrently on a single
server. In this when the Server starts running the client
will ask whether the server is ready so that it can start
the game and the server serves the request and the
game starts and they can play the game.
